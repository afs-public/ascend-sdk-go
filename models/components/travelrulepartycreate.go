// TravelRulePartyCreate - Travel rule party
type TravelRulePartyCreate struct {
	// Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains).
	//
	//  In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process.
	//
	//  Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as  https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of  fields outside countries where that field is used.
	//
